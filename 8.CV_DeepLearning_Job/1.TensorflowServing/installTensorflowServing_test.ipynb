This config file can be used to specify multiple models to serve and other advanced parameters including non-default version policy. (If used, --model_name, --model_base_path are ignored.)\n","\t--model_config_file_poll_wait_seconds=0\tint32\tInterval in seconds between each poll of the filesystemfor model_config_file.
